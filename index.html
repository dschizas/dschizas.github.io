                    About
                </h2>
                <p>I am a software engineer at the intersection of product development and user experience.</p>
                <p class="pt-4">
                    I have worked on multiple levels of application stacks. For the last four years, I have been focusing on shifting traditional insurance products' direction by introducing modern technologies for their core architecture. In <a class="bg-blue-200" href="https://www.azuruw.com/">Azur</a>, we use technology to change how carriers are handling customer acquisition, risk selection, underwriting and pricing.
                </p>
                <p class="pt-4">
                    The 2020 pandemic helped us attract talent without geographical restrictions. I feel lucky to work with engineers based in various locations (Mexico, Canada, UK, Poland, India and the Philippines) and tackle the challenge of being 100% remote with my team.
                </p>
                <p class="pt-4">
                    In 2012, I co-founded and developed an e-commerce travel website, captainwise.com.
                </p>
                <p class="pt-4">
                    These days, I am working on a new product, <a class="bg-blue-200" href="https://docex.io">docex.io</a>. docex.io aims to make the document generation process as simple as a click of a button.
